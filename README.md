This is the recipe to deploy your LUYA Website with [deployer](http://deployer.org).

> **Version 2.0 of LUYA Deployer uses latest [deployer](http://deployer.org) version which does not support the password() method. In order to use `password()` install verison ^1.0 of luya deployer! [See Version 1.0 Documentation](https://github.com/luyadev/luya-deployer/tree/1.0)**

## Install

Add the deployer composer package to your project:

```sh
composer require luyadev/luya-deployer --dev
```

Create a `deploy.php` file with the content of your server configuration(s) and store it in the root directory of your project:

```php
<?php
namespace Deployer;

require 'vendor/luyadev/luya-deployer/luya.php';

// define your configuration here
host('SSHHOST.COM')
    ->stage('prod')
    ->port(22)
    ->user('SSHUSER')
    ->set('deploy_path', '~/httpdocs');

set('repository', 'https://USER:PASSWORD@github.com/VENDOR/REPO.git');
```

To deploy to the above configured server just go into the console and run:

```sh
./vendor/bin/dep luya prod
```

If you have defined other servers like `prep`, `dev` etc you can just changed the server in the command. Lets say you have defined also a `dev` server:

```sh
./vendor/bin/dep luya dev
```

> In order to configure a branch to deploy use `set('branch', 'myCheckoutBranch');`

## Options

Several options and can be defined with `set(OPTION, VALUE)`. Its recommend to set the define the option for a given server:

```php
host('luya.io')
    ->stage('prod')
    ->set(COMPOSER_IGNORE_PLATFORM_REQS, true)
    ->set('deploy_path', '~/httpdocs');
```

Available Options

|Key|Constant|Default|Description
|---|--------|-------|-----
|`ignorePlatformReqs`|`COMPOSER_IGNORE_PLATFORM_REQS`|false|Whether composer install should ignore platform requierments or not.
|`installFxpPlugin`|`COMPOSER_INSTALL_FXP`|true|Whether composer global fxp plugin should be installed or not.
|`adminCoreCommands`|`LUYA_ADMIN_CORE_COMMANDS`|true|Wether the LUYA core commands like migrate, import should be run after deployment.


## Configure Hosting

In order to run your website, you have to modify the root directory of your website to `current/public_html` folder. Deployer will create the following folders:

+ current
+ releases
+ shared

Those folders are located in your defined `deploy_path` folder. So the `current/public_html` should be the only directory visible by the web.
