This is the recipe to deploy your LUYA Website with [PHP Deployer](http://deployer.org).

> **Version 2.0 of LUYA Deployer uses latest [PHP Deployer](http://deployer.org) version which does not support the password() method. In order to use `password()` install version ^1.0 of LUYA Deployer! [See Version 1.0 Documentation](https://github.com/luyadev/luya-deployer/tree/1.0)**

## Install

Add the deployer composer package to your project:

```sh
composer require luyadev/luya-deployer --dev
```

Create a `deploy.php` file with the content of your host configuration(s) and store it in the root directory of your project:

```php
<?php
namespace Deployer;

require 'vendor/luyadev/luya-deployer/luya.php';

// define your configuration here
host('SSHHOST.COM')
    ->stage('prod')
    ->port(22)
    ->user('SSHUSER')
    ->set('deploy_path', '~/httpdocs');

set('repository', 'https://USER:PASSWORD@github.com/VENDOR/REPO.git');
```

To deploy to the above configured server just go into the console and run:

```sh
./vendor/bin/dep luya prod
```

The LUYA Deployer will now deploy the to the above host with `prod` [Config](https://luya.io/api/luya-Config). The `stage()` method determines which [Config ENV](https://luya.io/api/luya-Config) should be taken, therefore those values must correlate each other.

## Configure Hosting

In order to run your website, you have to modify the root directory of your website to `current/public_html` folder. Deployer will create the following folders:

+ current
+ releases
+ shared

Those folders are located in your defined `deploy_path` folder. So the `current/public_html` should be the only directory visible by the web.

## Options

Several options and can be defined with `set(OPTION, VALUE)`. Its recommend to set the define the option for a given server:

```php
host('luya.io')
    ->stage('prod')
    ->set(COMPOSER_IGNORE_PLATFORM_REQS, true)
    ->set('deploy_path', '~/httpdocs');
```

Available Options

|Key|Constant|Default|Description
|---|--------|-------|-----
|`ignorePlatformReqs`|`COMPOSER_IGNORE_PLATFORM_REQS`|false|Whether composer install should ignore platform requirements or not.
|`installFxpPlugin`|`COMPOSER_INSTALL_FXP`|true|Whether composer global fxp plugin should be installed or not.
|`adminCoreCommands`|`LUYA_ADMIN_CORE_COMMANDS`|true|Whether the LUYA core commands like migrate, import should be run after deployment.

> In order to configure a branch to deploy use `set('branch', 'myCheckoutBranch');`

## Unglue

In order to use [unglue](https://unglue.io) you can add `after('luya:commands', 'unglue');` in your deploy.php. This will download the unglue phar file and compile the files according to the .unglue file.
## Authorization Password / SSH Key

Since the `password()` method has been removed, authentication can either be done using SSH Keys or by entering the password while deployment. The `dep luya prod` command will **prompt** for the users password unless he could not connect by SSH Key. By default the `~/.ssh/id_rsa` will be taken to make a first attempt. You can configure ssh settings with the following methods:

```php
->configFile('~/.ssh/config')
->identityFile('~/.ssh/id_rsa')
->forwardAgent(true)
->multiplexing(true)
```

Read the [PHP Deployer Docs](https://deployer.org/docs/hosts.html) for more informations. As we can not cover everything about SSH Keys but a here is a very basic example setup. First you have to create an SSH key, then the Server you'd like to connect must have stored the public key `.pub` file. So you should never publish the private key but the public key can be stored on the Server:

1. Generate an SSH Key `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -C "luyadeployer"`
2. When prompting for `Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):` skip this step (at least when setting up an continuous deployment f.e.).
3. Copy the content of `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` which is the public key.
4. Add the public key to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the Server or use `ssh-copy-id`. Also Plesk f.e. has visual tools to do so [Plesk SSH Keys Extension](https://www.plesk.com/extensions/ssh-keys/)
